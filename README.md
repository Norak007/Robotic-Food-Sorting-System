# Robotic-Food-Sorting-System
This robot sorts food boxes placed on the ground. It uses a barcode to know the type of food, then sends it to the right conveyor belt. Another robot takes the boxes from the conveyor and puts them on the correct shelf. The robot works automatically, but a human can help if there is a problem.
